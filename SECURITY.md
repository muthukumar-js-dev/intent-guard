You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Security Best Practices

When using Intent-Guard:

1. **Protect your `.intentguard/` directory**: Ensure it's committed to version control but review changes carefully
2. **Review protected regions**: Regularly audit files marked as `aiMutable: false`
3. **Validate before merging**: Always run `intent-guard validate` in CI/CD before merging AI-generated code
4. **Keep dependencies updated**: Run `npm audit` regularly to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
